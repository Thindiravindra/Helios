Feature Engineering Pipeline (Executive Summary)
The pipeline converts daily climate risk data into biologically meaningful supply-risk signals through a strictly causal, climate-only process. Country-level production-weighted aggregates capture severity and spatial exposure of drought, heat, cold, and excess precipitation. Persistence and cumulative stress features model biological damage accumulation over time. Phenology weighting aligns climate stress with crop growth stages, with separate calendars for Northern and Southern Hemisphere producers. Public, climate-derived soil moisture anomalies are used as physiological confirmation of plant stress. All features are aggregated to monthly granularity and exported as climate_risk_* variables only. No futures prices, returns, volatility, or market-derived data are used at any stage
